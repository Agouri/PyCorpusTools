## Installing
You need python3 and Tkinter3. Install using:
Anything above Python 3.6.5 will work. Check your version using:
```bash
python3 -V
```

Install tkinter3 by running:
```bash
sudo apt install python3-tk
```

Depending on how modern your distro is, you might also need to separately install `pyparsing`. Make sure you use pip3 instead of pip:
```bash
pip3 install pyparsing
```

Now just build the application using:
```bash
python3 mainFile.py
```
